# Basic DOM maniulation Methods:

## less used commands :

``` javascript
console.log(windows)
// window object

console.log(windows.document)
// document object
// this command also shows all hidden methods too
``` 

## most frequently used commands :
```js
console.log(document)
// it's eqivalent to  console.log(windows.document)
// but it just shows frequently used methods not all
console.dir(document)
// to show all the hidden methods as well.
```
## "documrnt" methods :
```js
document.baseURI
// give url of the current document

document.links
// gives all links in the current document
// but this list is not an Array but si,ilar to array, so some array prop can be applied on it.

document.getElementById
// as name suggests

document.getElementByClassName
// as name suggests
```
